# Weather Condition Classification and Rain Prediction
This project aims to perform classification on a weather condition dataset and evaluate the classification performance using classification_report. Additionally, it includes a prediction task to determine whether it will rain based on the classificated weather conditions using classification algorithms such as K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree Classifier, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
## Project Steps
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load the weather condition dataset.
- Handle missing values and perform necessary data cleaning.
- Standardize or normalize the data if required.
### 2. Classification
- Apply KNN, Decision Tree Classifier, and SVM to the preprocessed data.
- Choose appropriate hyperparameters for each classifier using techniques like cross-validation.
### 3. Evaluation
- Evaluate the classification performance.

### 4. Rain Prediction
- Use the classified weather conditions to predict whether it will rain.
- Implement a classification model to make the rain prediction.
- Evaluate the prediction accuracy and other relevant metrics.
